Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then 
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OGs age but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear yall for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause Im living too hard
And too foul how Im gon raise a child
When Im out here buck wild damn I had to slow down

Slow down slow down cause I cant take the heat slow down
Slow down baby

Mia X

And Feds cant take shit from me so slow down
Snoop

And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop pause rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the Wizard of Oz
And tell em that your tryin to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
Cause you realized that you hadnt played your part
And that was smart
Its like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See Ive been the flyest since I came out the gate

I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith
Fuck straight

Messing with my focus the locust on his grind

Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then its been real I gotta handle business
And you I know were in it see tripping gets you nowhere

Chorus
I dont need no bitch bitch bitch bitch all on me
Trippin and calling my phone always lying
I dont need no bitch bitch constantly checking on me

Verse 2  Devin the Dude
We used to rock to the rhythm that didnt stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause its over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I dont mean it like it sounds but we used to be a team
Yo we used to have a dream yo we used to put our things together
Now its dividing hiding bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches they come a dime a dozen
Fck one that once sucked my dick and find another bitches
I dont need em dont buy em nothing to drink I dont feed them bitches
Never mind them I stay in front I used to chase behind them
No I dont wine and dine them bitches

Chorus
I dont need no bitch bitch bitch bitch all on me
Trippin and calling my phone always lying
I dont need no bitch bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch dont even try it
Im out here grinding thats why
I dont need no bitch bitch bitch

Verse 3  Snoop Dogg
Hell no I dont need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
I dont need no bitch bitch bitch
The recipe for danger phone checking the recipe for anger
Im from a gang but I dont wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears bitch
Really Im the perfect stranger which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker maybe get little darker
But Ima have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox bitch see Dr Dre
Cause crazy aint gonna get it and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch Im on that bitch Im on that

Chorus
I dont need no bitch bitch bitch bitch all on me
Trippin and calling my phone always lying
I dont need no bitch bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch dont even try it
Im out here grinding thats why

You need to quit talking crazy

You need to quit talking crazy
So what we get drunk

Living young and wild and free

Verse 1 Wiz Khalifa
So what I keep em rolled up
Saggin my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean dont it
Washed it the other day watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kongs fingers
And smoke them hoes down til they stingers

Verse 1 Snoop Dogg
You know what

When the bodies hit the ground theres nothing left to say ay ay
Me dont want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me dont want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now

Chorus Snoop Lion  Cori B

Drake
Yeah yeah yeah news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Crying and saying to leave him alone but Im not leaving his side
I know that somebody died somebodys child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks them
They just cant wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didnt listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour something out for the lives that they stole
416


Chorus Snoop Lion  Cori B

Cuz its cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin
Which we create cuz thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens everyday
I woke up around 10 oclock in the mornin
I gave myself a strech up a mornin yawn and
went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all
There was a rubble dubble five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cuz my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
for all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white sox with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playin hard to get
So I said Whats wrong cuz she looked upset
She said um

Its all because of you im feelin said and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Ahuh ahuh ahuh

Damn now what was I to do
Shes cryin over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Somethin was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed my closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick
and sayin

Why dont you give me a play
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said Cheer up so I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin

A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin

Ill make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul let me take control

Chorus

Murder murder was the case that they gave me
Murder murder was the case that they gave me

Verse Two

Im fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
Its gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Livin like a baller loc
Havin money and blowin hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz and bought my BooBoo a Jag
And now Im rollin in a ninetrizzay El DoRad
Just remember who changed your mind
Cuz when you start settrippin that ass mine
Indeed agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want never have a need
They say Im greedy but I still want mo
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more really doe check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

No more indo gin and juice
Im on my way to Chino rollin on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
25 with an izzl with nowhere to gizzo I know
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face
Cuz its the OG DOdoubleG LBC
Mad doggin niggaz cuz I dont care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggaz stare as I enter the center
They send me to a leval 3 yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
Niggaz gettin they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cuz you cant tell whats next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo
I put that on my momma Ima ride for you Baby Boo
Its time to escape but I dont know where the fuck im headed
Up or down right or left life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt death becomes all niggaz
anybody killa you know what the deal is
Nigga you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin Yo Daz whats up with the Pound

Whats up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And cant no other motherfucker in LA or Long Beach

Pump pump put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in fuckin with the Pound is

RBX Suicide its a suicide 4X

Verse Two Snoop Doggy Dogg

The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue

Dont make a move for your gat so soon cuz

Walk with me hold my hand and let me lead you
Ill take you on a journey and I promise I wont leave you
I wont leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do thats when the mission
or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open cuz you dont wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker fore you make me

Now roam through the depths of hell

But when it isnt you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack ha ha

Chorus
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father Father
Repeat

Lets make a move for this paper Where we rollin Dogg

And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
Im so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga dont beat em cause if you beat em you dont need em
You lay your hands on me watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em but dont mistreat em
I stay up on em and thats one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang is everythang
There aint no mo than this paper chase
Like them whiteboy DAs was on tha case
You know I aint tryin ta floss but uh
Murder murder murder was the case that they lost
Im Tha DoggFather

Chorus

Now do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasnt no Snoop Dogg Hell yeah
There wasnt no rappers hollin bout LBC
Am I trippin yall Hell no
Now when I grow up I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
Thats the truth from the begining
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family dont know me
Hold on hommie thats formost and promos
Sales tails scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin ta give my peeps just what they need
And it aint no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But Ima git back to tha grizzind
Snoop DO double G comin back for mizzine and
Im tha DoggFather
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
while youre bangin on ya baby OGs
Thats why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey
If Im hangin its with DPG
repeat

Verse 1 Snoop Doggy Dogg

Some do the things that they do cos they dumb
and some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see
Not the big homey double OG
Scared to do your own work man thats fast
and thats the reason why I had to shoot you down
because you never shouldve tried to work my Dogg
and the lil homey wouldnt had no reason to bump
Yall know the game aint the same no mo
Lil Gs keep heat so big Gs freeze geez
Johnny Rockafella went to jailer
few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
but they wont sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin ta find em cos you want em they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come nigga look out
it aint hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
but its hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But its steel you put it in their head
that at 13 they better off dead now they gone

Chorus

Verse 2 Kurupt

Aiyo Snoop why would niggas get into the bracket
and make a loot niggas want trip
Spittin like you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or dont show me shit
Feel the fever million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a nonbelievin man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day my homies say
its the way to get paid DPs and pay
I dont know why you wanna get on my back why
Trippin cos you know the bombs at where Im at
Well if thats the case you shoulda roll
wit the PG instead of losing control motherfucker
This is how we do Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me DAZ NATE and Snoop
Niggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways
so ask DJ Pooh what pays

Chorus

Verse 3 Snoop Dogg

Just what we need bangin on wax another trip
What you gon do nigga jack the mothership
Youre like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon kill in your verse
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
cos uhh real hoobangers are toastslangers
not parttime FBI singers
Niggas havin bad intentions sendin BGs on a mission
One move too many nigga you missin
Listen you fuck wit the cycolicno
loony ass nigga from your HdoubleOD
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin
but guess what it cost em they crossin me
But before I give a nigga a 9
Id rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme
Homey Ai Dogg let me holla atcha man
Snoop Wuz up home
Homey Word is on the streets
Your beats gone be delicate since Dre did shake the speas out
man
Snoop Delicate Beats
So thats what makes me now
Man I dont give a fuck about no beat

Now let me shake that shit man
I hear ya Dogg
Its a cold cold thing
Its a cold thing
For real hmm

I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand actin way too funny
Doin too much yknow I see it from the getgo
What the fucks goin on wit you niggas yall tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess its time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game Im a stumble in like I dont know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong Im takin off from the getgo
I aint givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and Ima tell you man thats the worst
Fifth in the world but Ima keep my thang together
Cos Ima keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers man now what yall niggas doin
All yall broke on the corner drinkin your drink wanna be doin what Im
doin
But dont get mad and dont be tryin to playhate
Cos uhh takin trips around state to state
Representin uhh what yall wanna represent
But yall cant represent it cos yall got no dollars no cents
Im movin on groovin on and Im movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get Gs across the town tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this she gone come holla at a player do
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do we gone be sippin on some Cognac
Its on me Im feelin good tonight
Cos Ima do mines and Ima keep everything tight
I aint lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak then Im get caught
And I cant get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit bitches is cold on a nigga who aint got his game tight
Gettin 18point5 percent half your life
Shit I love my baby boy and all
But I aint gonna be payin no bitch no no no way Dogg
Im too slick on my toes Im too tight
Im guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat aint that right
Cos uhh when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You cant be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you aint with the game the game aint gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

Interlude Snoop talking

Verse 1 Snoop Doggy Dogg

Shucks stompin in my big blue chucks

All day illustration beat conversation

Chorus

Verse 2 Snoop Dogg

I keep niggas in the studio word is bond
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong
and still cant come up with the right song
You know what they sayStudy long study long
All aboard the train so come along
cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone
Its alright aint no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans thats crazy like DeNiro
Im international money maker player hater
shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
at a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and cant get on the mic

Chorus x1 12

Verse 3 Snoop Dogg

Killin up crews give em the real street blues
Have em slidin in their eelskins groovin in their tennis shoes
Of course it dont stop bein a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoo thats how they got the clue
I lay conversation on wax and CDs
BGs and originals here come the mission
Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey uhh
I represent the LBCment
Windows tint nigga thats the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like its laced but it aint
This one puff uncut no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half
Josey Wales was known for robbin trains and things
layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in see
Cos if I pull out some heat nigga youll go kick in
And thats just the rules set by the fool from the ol school
When its time to duel you get two men
Two heaters one street one clock
and when it strike twelve one of yall gon drop
If youre quick on the draw youre gon see the morgue
but if youre too slow
I catch you on the downlow Oh no
Oh no you mean The Kid shits real
I aint no John Wayne these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen thats the click Im wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah were on a mission ta Kansas slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses enforcers of courses
The niggas in black the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush baby got ta have it I gots ta have it
It feels just like its 1865
and a trigger lookaday is how I ride

Kurupt

On and on and on its more strange
Time to heat shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify nigga you aint never lie
Besides Im in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The offtherocker roller coaster
On a sixshooter holster
with DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
attached to this skirt in the corner
so I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
or getcha pockets shaken clean the slugs in ya spleen
I cant help it Im heartless ya cant hack it
With my sixshooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
The gold rush

 from LBC Crew

Born is Doggystyle individual James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
Im on the move smooth to my decoy horse
A 3030 on my side to shoot a nigga o course
It aint no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators set back the clientele
Oh well for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

Bad Azz from LBC Crew

Two sacks o money from the train heist
They aint even counted it up
just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster sixshooters in the holster
Pass thru a rundown town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
so I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black caught five miles west
sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
he didnt have a 20 he had they beadspipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get right Im off into the sunset
tryin ta reach my destiny fast
Its these two bags o cash
44s cocked I aint makin no mo stops
till I hit the spot I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs I cocked my strap and slept tight
At the gold rush at the gold rush
at the gold rush at the gold rush
at the at the at the
The dog saw imthey teartheylooked liked they try to tear him off
I said Oh my God They want to eat my husband

Verse 1

I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio I was gettin thinner
My nigga SparkyO was playin basketball
and my niggas in the backyard yall about to squab my Doggz
Dirty  gets CREAM its a good scheme
But you know its all a part of the Corleone team
I squabbleFriday cos thats what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga uhh thought you knew
but you didnt you think Im kiddin nigga my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs bring em right to the back
Hit the gate dont wait and ask the homey Nate

Now theyve got Michael Corleone
Oh Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on uhh
and aint no need to reach for heat cos you cant get your blast on
Doggz we keep em busters we sweep em
and when its time all my Doggzll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And Ima dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit the one I had named Petey
Uhh she got killed so I didnt need him
Uhh its like that what about Sweetie
He got killed too damn so I didnt need him
Its a cold thang but its a cold game
but when you wit a Corleone name its a cold thang
Cold name cold game ya got ta get down
cos if you dont then you cant represent the Pound
Now its like a sport
and if I get caught Im right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and dont yeezell
but you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one get one holla atcha boy quick
cos Ima be on the lookout for the selltodem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I came Scarface Corleone killers baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
but the rest of the pits they rollin wit me

Ma bark and shell spark up some shit real quick
Just last week yknow what She bit the shit out of me

Hook

Beware beware

I keep my heat in my seat my killers in my backyard

Outro reporter speaking over hook

deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people
encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know Im
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez
Its too much for me to be givin to you
Uh all Im givin is some dick in you
Now Sh I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that aint all she blew
Hey I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin bout lovin me in the week
I said thats too damn quick and too damn fast
Youve been givin up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass
Nah nah nah you aint gettin me like that
Soopafly aint even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped I went on one
Stepped in the club Caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop she was soft and smooth
Talkin bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin bout the cost
Man that same bus stop is where
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You cant ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You aint got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me

You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Till I turned around and whupped yo ass
like a pimp and thats for real

Snoop Dogg
I came through in a zoot suit pin stripe lookin too cute
Tryin to get my shoot on so Im a scoot on
Over to the next bitch say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasnt the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama short for Alabama
A big bad mamajamma now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got alot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a tshirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I dont see a god damn thang
Thats stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
Itd look nice on my finger Im a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hiphop singer
Your homegirl bring her cause Ive been dying to meet her
You know I wont cheat her dont mistreat her
She only get the dick Ill never ever eat her
But Ill drop her ass cause you know I dont need her
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say big things come in small packages baby

You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
trick beyotch beyotch

Too hort
I said beyyyotch what are you smokin
A big fat dick comin from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich bitch
Gold diggin tramps tryin to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas aint trippin during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up itd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
Whatd you do hort introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you make yourself comfortable
You fuckin with a dog bitch you aint fin to come up hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the eastside
How much for the game that Im sellin
Aint no tellin like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but Im a tell you though
Couldnt spend on shit that aint valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin
Told her Im a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin me to do somethin for the time she spent
Its funny cause now she cant find the rent money

You thought you had my grip
But Too hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
trick beyotch beyotch

I got family members homeboys
Muthafuckaz I look out way before you

For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time what Im gonna do
Tell ya how its spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records Never Leave Me Alone
Aint No Fun now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it shed always fess
Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasnt no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didnt appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe thats extra cheap
And now she stop flautin and wont it speakin
Be comin round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be beggin please
Dyin for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin thats kinda plain
He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasnt nuthin like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now hes grown up to be a surprise
DAZ got a hit record slangin world wide
Now the same people that didnt like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food Doggfather and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha LBC
Known ta yall as DJ Warren G
He cut grass trasform wit finesse
 and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvins record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but theres no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha VIP would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offerin him a job but nah he dont want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasnt
Now guess what they call sessy bussin

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasnt tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 21 street
and said Can I be down champ They said
no and treated me like a wet food stamp
after gettin rejected I aint runnin upset
I said Whats a Dogg do to Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set MC straight
I aint never love no hoe since Im listenin to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G
We used to see Daz back in the day
It happens all the time so brother dont be amazed

You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors
You got the papers
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce yall
repeat

Its structures to this game its instinct mixed with knowledge
Im a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open focus scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
cos Ima make things get better for me
and keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The LLG wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide the East is my side
Ima tell you long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got aint gonna work you better audible
Oh yes Im fresh and like spy from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
to supply you wit what you need no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
dont bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life life is struggle
without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that fragile as a crsytal
Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol
or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
and put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me Im tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce yall

Chorus

Just keep it real Dogg

3rd Verse
It takes a whole lot
to be number one
I cant walk down the street

I cant trust these niggas fool
It aint no fun
Im sittin up in court
Cuz somebody got dumped
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say
Snoop rocked the parte
Nobody got kilt
Its what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll

Gettin money at the Plizate with my initials

Burning rubber down to get a new car

VERSE 1KURUPT
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times
Im sedated my conscriptiated from beginning
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my loccs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from Long Beach
To my bulls out in Philly coz all they smoke is phillies
Wit these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in 
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click thatll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin casesrobberies and assaults
It aint my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen inget elevated off the verbal contact

BRIGDEDAT NIGGA DAZ
When a nigga gotta strive for his he cant stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he cant stop
Gotta get somewhere

VERSE 2DAZBAD AZZunknown
My mindstate these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt em in the worst wayput it down for myself
Put em to restconfess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the junglewhile mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with DAZ
I represent it to the fullestit could be a verbal massacre
In 96with a diffrent approach Im shit
I got the flavour and Im majorbust the ass
Niggas cant stop us and cant fade us
Shady ass niggas cant stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to yaswift as a cheetah when Im catchin ya
I betcha I wont let ya escape
Facetoreal on pointtotrainto kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the arearather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
Im a LBC on throughstayin true
Demanding my respectrespect is what Ive given
So respect is what I expectthe money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Dont catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
45 calibre Glockgatgun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the clickdamn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loosethis is premeditated dickup
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but cant fade it
With the every attempt they failoh well
Consequences get sufferedI put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crispthe deal is the deal is this
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
Im stompinsteppin with my projectile weapon

Wuz up Jexsos eject the hum
When I swarm throughwho knew about the real deal I conceal
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a mustIf I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence
Bringin drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceivedsomethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also DPGs and LBCs
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as bombin yasuffer from insomnia
And Im a gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
Watch out nigga

1st Verse
Now if you tired of the hard work
tears and sweat
and you breakin your neck
and you still up in debt
Walkin round town all strapped in
niggas be havin more bad times than Captain Rat did
Two strikes none left out of breath
Livin in the city its a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
you havin more problems than a algebra test
You cant seem to come up wit yo money for rent
and now yo baby momma trippin she want fifty percent
Its a thin line between yours and mine
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine Well go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

Chorus

2nd Verse
Oh your homies think youre funny
Doin stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys This is for the honeys
Got yo rocks so you keepem in the sack
you got two strikes but you right back up to bat
You all about yo money and got something to sell
but if you bail for a robber youll be back in the jail cell
You chillin wit yo feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
thats when you got beat up
Because you cant be out there doin low
and then right gather up yo crew and roll
Aint no rules when you out there doin dirt
somebodys always layin in the cut to get ya hurt
But see I know a place where
you might wanna be
and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine Well go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

Chorus

Bridge One
Here ye Here ye come one come all
To a place that be call it LBC
Im ridin wit ya baby
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick
know what Im sayin
Cuz he travelin in the fast lane

Stop the life it seem that we are on
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Stop the life it seem that we are on
time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home

Verse three
Doggyland is the town where its goin dizowne
Its goin down
Everything is free
and aint no HIV What
And niggas dont kill one another
Oh really why is that
Because a brother is a brother
And what about the mothers
They queens
righteous
man
heaven must be like this
green aroma like the grass in the summertime
Aint no peneteneries and aint nobody doin time
And oh yeah Im the big OKer
Im smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
Heaven on Earth
its like a prayer
And you cant get in without yo gold card you got
to be a player
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there
Pop goes the nine well go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smackdead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal businessracketeerin
Smugglindoin things from handin a gunis what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locationsspots where it takes place
If you show them my moneyyour ass is gettin flaid
Theres four major games that run the city of Gs
The violatorsthe Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murders an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chipsjag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Naythe charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all dropcircle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their asscommence to takin them out

INTERLUDEDAZ talking
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugsdope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75 of our town as the young
youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country but they cant
The murders have increased more than 95 and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

VERSE TWOTRAY DEE
I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop
Young crook keepin hookniggashakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for helpyou help yourself cos theres no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only Gs and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trustbustbe aware and I aint ya curse
Cos the niggas that I dared to agank the first
Think I might be deceased fore I reach my calling
As long as Im haulin my heat Im stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Dont speak on the creepmo fools is listenin
And war story glory aint worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya settill ya bite the deck

I come through blastinme as a Downtown Assassin
Mashinmay they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Shouldve known from the gatewhos the baddest
In my zoneDon Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the USCI shift kisa 120 plane rides
Multiplied by Gs873 million in a matter omonths
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebratenew empire to make
Toast till we all dietill we burst and break
From knives to gunsfrom the rich to the slums
We ran outta dopeI dont think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks aspark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an examplewhat I saidya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myselfme my dopeme and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judgesI budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs
